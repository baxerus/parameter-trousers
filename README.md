# parameter-trousers

A simple webside to generate trouser cut patterns that can get printed and glued together. Mostly for children trousers (but I simply didn't create one for a grown up yet).

Developed and tested with Chrome (around version 65 on Mac OS X), may or may not work with other browsers.

**Beware of scaling of prints in the print dialog!** The pattern includes a labled square to measure the scaling of your prints. First get the 'Maximum width' and 'Maximum height' of your printer right (with test prints and measuring), before you create a dozen page print, cutout, glue and get angry:angry: at the end :thumbsup:.
